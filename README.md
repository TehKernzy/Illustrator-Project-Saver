This script opens a dialog window where you can choose a designated project folder you want to save your current document in. You can select a folder from a drop-down list that shows the most recently modified or added folders. Along with the drop-down, there is a “Create New Project” button that prompts a new window to name and create a new project folder. Once the new project folder is created you are presented a new window with the ability to name and save your file.

The script is designed to work on Windows operating systems, and the default folder for saving files is "C:/Projects". However, you can change the folder path by editing the code in the script. The script also includes a function that sorts the subfolders in the selected folder by date modified, so the most recently modified folder is always listed first in the drop-down list.
